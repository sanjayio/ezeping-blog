When it comes to monitoring the health of your SaaS applications, choosing the right plan can make a significant difference. Free monitoring plans are an excellent starting point for many businesses, but they might not provide all the capabilities needed for scaling operations or handling large volumes of data. In this article, we’ll break down the differences between free and paid SaaS monitoring plans and help you determine which option is best suited to your business needs.

[ezePing](https://ezeping.com) offers both a free and a pro plan, each designed with specific use cases in mind. Let’s explore what each plan includes and the key considerations for choosing between them.

## Free SaaS Monitoring Plan: What It Offers

The **free plan** from ezePing includes:

- **3 Event Categories**: Track up to 3 types of events, such as login attempts, critical errors, or transactions, making it a good choice for monitoring essential actions.
- **100 Events per Month**: Perfect for small businesses, side projects, or applications with low to moderate traffic, allowing you to test ezePing’s capabilities without a financial commitment.
- **Basic Insights**: With the free plan, you’ll get an overview of your application’s performance and gain valuable data on user behavior and system uptime.

The free plan is ideal for:

- **Startups and Small Businesses**: Those with limited budgets who need basic monitoring features.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Developers and teams who want to try ezePing’s monitoring capabilities before committing to a paid plan.
- **Low-Traffic Applications**: Applications with minimal users or events can effectively track performance without exceeding the event limit.

While the free plan covers essential monitoring, it may not be enough for teams with complex needs or larger user bases. Let’s dive into the paid option to understand its added benefits.

## Paid (Pro) SaaS Monitoring Plan: What It Offers

The **pro plan** from ezePing is a one-time payment plan priced at 49 AUD and includes:

- **10 Event Categories**: Track up to 10 types of events, which allows for more comprehensive monitoring of various user actions, system errors, and transaction flows.
- **1,000 Events per Month**: Suitable for applications with moderate to high traffic, providing ample capacity for businesses to monitor their applications consistently without worrying about event limits.
- **Advanced Customization**: With more event categories and a higher event limit, the pro plan allows teams to capture detailed insights across different areas of the application, enabling more granular analysis.

The pro plan is best for:

- **Growing Businesses**: Teams with larger user bases or those experiencing growth in traffic who need reliable monitoring to ensure stability and performance.
- **Complex Applications**: Applications with numerous critical events, such as multi-step transactions or extensive API usage, which require tracking across multiple categories.
- **Proactive Monitoring Needs**: Businesses looking to set up alerts for multiple events and want flexibility in defining which aspects of the application to monitor in real time.

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|

| **Event Limit per Month**  | 100                                    | 1,000                            |
| **Ideal For**              | Small projects, low traffic apps       | Growing apps, higher traffic     |
| **Customization**          | Basic                                  | Advanced                         |
| **Cost**                   | Free                                   | One-time fee of 49 AUD           |

The choice between the free and pro plan depends on your application’s specific needs, budget, and user volume. For startups and small applications, the free plan provides valuable insights without cost. However, if your application is scaling or has complex monitoring needs, the pro plan offers flexibility and greater event capacity, making it worth the investment.

## When to Upgrade to a Paid Plan

If you’re already on the free plan, here are a few signs that it may be time to upgrade to the pro plan:

1. **You’re Reaching Event Limits Regularly**: If you find yourself frequently hitting the 100 events/month cap, the pro plan’s 1,000 events/month will give you the capacity you need.
2. **Need for Advanced Tracking**: As your application grows, you may need to track more than 3 event categories, especially if you’re managing complex workflows or user actions.
3. **High-Volume Application**: Applications with a large user base or higher traffic benefit from the pro plan’s extended limits and advanced features.
4. **Desire for Detailed Analysis**: If you need insights into specific event types or user segments, the pro plan’s extra categories offer more flexibility for in-depth monitoring.
